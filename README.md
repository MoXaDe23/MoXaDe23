# 👨‍⚕️ Nelson Mugume | Bridging Medicine & Data Science 🚀

Hi there! 👋 I'm **Nelson Mugume**, a medical officer from Uganda 🇺🇬 with a deep curiosity for **technology**, **data**, and the **future of healthcare**. I’ve spent years treating patients and solving clinical challenges—and now, I'm bringing that same drive to the world of **data science**, one project at a time.

## 🧠 My Mission

To harness the power of **data and AI** to drive more innovative healthcare solutions, support innovation in public health, and empower others with accessible technology.

Whether I’m working with **Python**, **SQL**, **Power BI**, or **machine learning models**, I love transforming raw data into insights that matter.

I’m looking to collaborate on Data Projects.

## 🙏 Faith & Focus

As a Christian, I believe in purpose-driven work and making a meaningful impact through service and innovation. Before every big step, I take a moment to **pray, reflect, and act**.

The Bible says in Genesis 1:1, In the beginning God....., thus, always start anything your hands find to do with God, and you'll surely succeed.
